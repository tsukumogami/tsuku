# IS01: Strikethrough item is not closed

An issue or milestone in the Implementation Issues table is marked as completed (with strikethrough formatting) but is still open in GitHub.

## Expected Format

Strikethrough uses double tildes `~~` around the entire cell content:

```markdown
| ~~[#123](https://github.com/org/repo/issues/123)~~ | ~~Issue title~~ | ~~None~~ | ~~testable~~ |
```

## How to Fix

Either:
1. **Remove strikethrough** if the issue is not actually complete:
   ```markdown
   | [#123](https://github.com/org/repo/issues/123) | Issue title | None | testable |
   ```

2. **Close the issue in GitHub** if the work is complete

## Note on PRs

If your PR will close the issue (via `Fixes #123` in PR body or commit message), the strikethrough is correct and validation will pass.

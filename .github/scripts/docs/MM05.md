# MM05: Invalid status class

A node is assigned an invalid class name.

## Valid Classes

| Class | Color | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `done` | Green (#c8e6c9) | Issue is closed |
| `ready` | Blue (#bbdefb) | Open, no blocking dependencies |
| `blocked` | Yellow (#fff9c4) | Open, has open blockers |
| `needsDesign` | Purple (#e1bee7) | Future work, not yet designed |

## How to Fix

Use one of the valid class names:

**Before (invalid):**
```
class I123 complete
```

**After:**
```
class I123 done
```

## Class Definitions

Include the standard class definitions in your diagram:

```
classDef done fill:#c8e6c9
classDef ready fill:#bbdefb
classDef blocked fill:#fff9c4
classDef needsDesign fill:#e1bee7
```

# IS02: Closed item missing strikethrough

An issue or milestone in the Implementation Issues table is closed in GitHub (or will be closed by this PR) but is not marked as completed with strikethrough formatting.

## Expected Format

Strikethrough uses double tildes `~~` around the entire cell content:

**Before (incorrect):**
```markdown
| [#123](https://github.com/org/repo/issues/123) | Issue title | None | testable |
```

**After (correct):**
```markdown
| ~~[#123](https://github.com/org/repo/issues/123)~~ | ~~Issue title~~ | ~~None~~ | ~~testable~~ |
```

## How to Fix

Add `~~` around each cell in the row for the closed issue:

1. Issue column: `~~[#123](url)~~`
2. Title column: `~~Issue title~~`
3. Dependencies column: `~~None~~` or `~~[#456](url)~~`
4. Tier column: `~~testable~~`

## Mermaid Diagram

Also update the diagram's class assignment to mark the issue as done:

```mermaid
class I123 done
```

# MM16a: needs-design label must use needsDesign class

An issue with the `needs-design` label has a class other than `needsDesign` in the diagram. The label and class must agree.

## Why This Matters

The `needs-design` label indicates the issue requires its own design exploration before implementation. The Mermaid class must reflect this so the diagram accurately shows the issue's state.

## How to Fix

Change the class to `needsDesign`:

**Before (incorrect):**
```
class I123 ready
```

**After (correct):**
```
class I123 needsDesign
```

Alternatively, if the design work is done, remove the `needs-design` label from the GitHub issue and use the appropriate class.

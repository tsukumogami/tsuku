# MM16: needs-design issue cannot be ready

An issue with the `needs-design` label has class `ready` in the diagram. Issues that still need design work should use the `needsDesign` class instead.

## Why This Matters

The `ready` class signals that an issue can be picked up for implementation. An issue with `needs-design` isn't ready for implementation yet -- it needs a design doc or design review first.

## How to Fix

Change the class from `ready` to `needsDesign`:

**Before (incorrect):**
```
class I123 ready
```

**After (correct):**
```
class I123 needsDesign
```

Alternatively, if the design work is done, remove the `needs-design` label from the GitHub issue.

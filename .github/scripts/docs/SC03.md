# SC03: Empty Security Considerations

The Security Considerations section is empty or contains only "N/A".

## Why This Matters

For tsuku (a package manager that downloads and executes binaries), security analysis is mandatory. Every design must address how it handles:

- **Download verification**: How are binaries validated?
- **Execution isolation**: What permissions are required?
- **Supply chain risks**: Where do binaries come from?
- **User data exposure**: What data is accessed or transmitted?

## How to Fix

Add meaningful security analysis to the section.

**Example - Before (invalid):**
```markdown
## Security Considerations

N/A
```

**Example - After:**
```markdown
## Security Considerations

### Download Verification
All binaries are verified via SHA256 checksums published on the tool's official releases page.

### Execution Isolation
Installed tools run with user permissions only. No sudo or elevated privileges required.

### Supply Chain Risks
Downloads come directly from official GitHub releases. The recipe specifies exact version and checksum.

### User Data Exposure
This feature does not access or transmit any user data.
```

## Note

If a dimension genuinely doesn't apply, explain why instead of writing "N/A".

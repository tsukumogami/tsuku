# MM21: tracksDesign validation

A `tracksDesign` node is missing its required child reference row, or a non-`tracksDesign` node has a child reference row it shouldn't.

## Rules

- If a node has class `tracksDesign`, it **must** have a child reference row (`^_Child: [DESIGN-name.md](path)_`) in the Implementation Issues table.
- If a node does **not** have class `tracksDesign`, it must **not** have a child reference row.
- **Exception**: A `done` node with a struck-through child reference row is valid. This represents the completed state where the child design reached Current.

## Why This Matters

The `tracksDesign` class and child reference row must be bidirectionally consistent. A `tracksDesign` node without a child reference provides no way to find the child design. A child reference row on a non-tracking node is misleading.

## How to Fix

**tracksDesign without child reference:**

Add a child reference row between the issue row and description row:

```markdown
| [#123](url) | track design for feature X | None | simple |
| ^_Child: [DESIGN-feature-x.md](docs/designs/DESIGN-feature-x.md)_ | | | |
| _Description of the issue._ | | |
```

**Child reference on wrong class:**

Either change the class to `tracksDesign`:
```
class I123 tracksDesign
```

Or remove the child reference row if the node shouldn't track a child design.

# SD01: File in wrong directory

The design document's status doesn't match its directory location.

## Directory Mapping

| Status | Required Directory |
|--------|-------------------|
| Proposed | `docs/designs/` |
| Accepted | `docs/designs/` |
| Planned | `docs/designs/` |
| Current | `docs/designs/current/` |
| Superseded | `docs/designs/archive/` |

## How to Fix

Move the file to the correct directory for its status.

**Example - Status is "Current" but file is in wrong location:**
```bash
# Move from docs/designs/ to docs/designs/current/
git mv docs/designs/DESIGN-feature.md docs/designs/current/DESIGN-feature.md
```

**Example - Status is "Superseded":**
```bash
# Move to archive
git mv docs/designs/DESIGN-old-feature.md docs/designs/archive/DESIGN-old-feature.md
```

## Note

The directories must exist. Create them if needed:
```bash
mkdir -p docs/designs/current docs/designs/archive
```

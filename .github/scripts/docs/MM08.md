# MM08: Only one diagram per document

Multiple Mermaid diagrams were found in the design document.

**Note:** This rule only applies to **Planned** status documents. Current status documents are historical records and may contain multiple diagrams for documentation or example purposes.

## Expected Behavior

Each **Planned** design document should have exactly one dependency diagram in the Implementation Issues section.

## Why This Matters

- Multiple diagrams create confusion about which is authoritative
- Tooling expects a single diagram to update when issue status changes
- The diagram should represent the complete dependency graph for the design

## How to Fix

Consolidate all nodes and edges into a single diagram:

**Before (invalid - multiple diagrams):**
```mermaid
graph TD
    I1["#1: Task A"]
```

```mermaid
graph TD
    I2["#2: Task B"]
```

**After:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    I1["#1: Task A"]
    I2["#2: Task B"]

    I1 --> I2
```

## Using Subgraphs for Organization

If you need to group related issues visually, use subgraphs within a single diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Phase1["Phase 1"]
        I1["#1: Task A"]
    end

    subgraph Phase2["Phase 2"]
        I2["#2: Task B"]
    end

    I1 --> I2
```

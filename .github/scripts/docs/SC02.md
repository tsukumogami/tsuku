# SC02: Wrong section order

A section appears in the wrong position relative to other required sections.

## Required Order

Sections must appear in this order:

1. `## Status`
2. `## Context and Problem Statement`
3. `## Decision Drivers`
4. `## Considered Options`
5. `## Decision Outcome`
6. `## Solution Architecture`
7. `## Implementation Approach`
8. `## Security Considerations`
9. `## Consequences`

## How to Fix

Move the section to its correct position in the document.

**Example - Before (wrong order):**
```markdown
## Status
...

## Decision Outcome
...

## Context and Problem Statement  <-- This should come before Decision Outcome
...
```

**Example - After:**
```markdown
## Status
...

## Context and Problem Statement
...

## Decision Outcome
...
```

## Note

Additional sections (like `## Implementation Issues`) can appear anywhere and don't affect ordering validation.

# MM17: No open blockers but class is blocked

A node has class `blocked` but none of its upstream dependencies are actually open on GitHub. If all blockers are closed (or being closed by the current PR), the node isn't blocked.

## How Blocking is Determined

The validation parses the mermaid diagram's edge relationships (`A --> B` means A blocks B) and checks the actual GitHub state of each blocker. A node is only considered blocked if at least one upstream dependency is open.

## How to Fix

Update the class to reflect the node's actual state:

- If the issue has a `needs-design` label, use `needsDesign`
- Otherwise, use `ready`

**Before (incorrect -- all blockers are closed):**
```
class I123 blocked
```

**After (correct):**
```
class I123 ready
```

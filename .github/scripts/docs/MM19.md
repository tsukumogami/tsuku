# MM19: needsDesign node has open blockers

A node with class `needsDesign` has open blocking dependencies. Nodes with open blockers should use class `blocked` instead.

## Why This Matters

The `needsDesign` class indicates future work that hasn't been designed yet. However, if a node has open dependencies, it's also blocked -- and the `blocked` status takes precedence since it reflects the actual workflow state.

## How to Fix

Change the node's class from `needsDesign` to `blocked`:

```
class I1315 blocked
```

Or if the dependency is already complete, remove the dependency edge and keep `needsDesign`.

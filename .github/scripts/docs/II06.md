# II06: Child design reference link validation

A child reference row links to a design document that does not exist.

## Rules

For each child reference row in the Implementation Issues table:
- `| ^_Child: [DESIGN-name.md](relative/path)_ | | | |`
- `| ~~^_Child: [DESIGN-name.md](relative/path)_~~ | | | |`

The referenced file path is resolved relative to the design doc's directory and must point to an existing file.

## Why This Matters

Child design references provide navigation from parent design docs to their spawned child designs. Broken links make the parent doc harder to navigate and indicate the child design may have been moved or deleted without updating the parent.

## How to Fix

Update the child reference row to point to the correct file:

```markdown
| ^_Child: [DESIGN-feature-x.md](docs/designs/DESIGN-feature-x.md)_ | | | |
```

If the child design was moved (e.g., from `planned/` to `current/`), update the path accordingly.

## Cross-repo References

References that are absolute URLs (starting with `http://` or `https://`) or that resolve to paths outside the repository root emit a warning but do not fail this check. Cross-repo validation requires access to the other repository which CI cannot guarantee.

# II07: Issue row missing required description row

Every issue row in the Implementation Issues table must be followed by a description row.

## Expected Format

Each issue row should be immediately followed by a description row (italic text in the first cell, remaining cells empty):

```markdown
| [#509: fix description row parsing](url) | None | testable |
| _Fix the awk skip filter so struck-through description rows work._ | | |
```

If the issue has a child reference row, it goes between the issue row and the description row:

```markdown
| [#1701: design dashboard observability](url) | None | simple |
| ^_Child: [DESIGN-dashboard-observability.md](path)_ | | | |
| _Designs the observability layer for the pipeline dashboard._ | | |
```

## How to Fix

Add a description row after the issue row. The description should briefly summarize what the issue does.

**Before (invalid):**
```markdown
| [#123](url) | None | testable |
| [#124](url) | [#123](url) | testable |
```

**After:**
```markdown
| [#123](url) | None | testable |
| _Implement the first feature._ | | |
| [#124](url) | [#123](url) | testable |
| _Build on feature one to add feature two._ | | |
```

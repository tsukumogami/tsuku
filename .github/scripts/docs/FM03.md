# FM03: Status mismatch

The `status` field in the frontmatter doesn't match the status shown in the document body's `## Status` section.

## Expected Behavior

Both locations must show the same status value:

```yaml
---
status: Accepted
...
---
```

```markdown
## Status

**Accepted**
```

## How to Fix

Update either the frontmatter or body status so they match.

**Common causes:**
1. Updated one location but forgot the other
2. Copy-paste from a template with different status

## Body Status Formats

The validation accepts these formats in the `## Status` section:

```markdown
## Status

**Accepted**
```

or

```markdown
## Status

Accepted
```

or (for Superseded):

```markdown
## Status

Superseded by [DESIGN-new-feature.md](path)
```

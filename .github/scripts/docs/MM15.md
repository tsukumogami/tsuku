# MM15: Class doesn't match issue open/closed status

A node's class assignment doesn't match its GitHub open/closed state.

## Rules

| GitHub State | Expected Class |
|-------------|----------------|
| Closed (or PR closing it) | `done` |
| Open | NOT `done` |

## Why This Matters

- Closed issues showing as `ready` or `blocked` mislead readers
- Open issues showing as `done` suggest work is complete when it isn't
- The diagram should reflect actual project state

## How to Fix

**Issue is closed but not marked done:**
```
class I123 done
```

**Issue is open but marked done:**
Change to the appropriate class (`ready`, `blocked`, or `needsDesign`) based on its actual state.

## Related Rules

- MM16: needs-design label cannot be ready
- MM17: No open blockers cannot be blocked
- MM18: Open blocker cannot be ready

## Note

This check requires the `gh` CLI to be available and authenticated. If `gh` is not available or the issue cannot be fetched, this validation is skipped for that node.

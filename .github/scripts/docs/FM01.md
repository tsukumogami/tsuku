# FM01: Missing frontmatter field

A required field is missing from the YAML frontmatter at the top of the design document.

## Required Fields

All design documents must have these 4 fields in their frontmatter:

```yaml
---
status: Proposed
problem: One sentence describing the problem being solved.
decision: One sentence stating what was decided.
rationale: 1-2 sentences explaining why this approach was chosen.
---
```

## How to Fix

Add the missing field to the frontmatter block at the very top of the file.

**Example - Before (missing `rationale`):**
```yaml
---
status: Proposed
problem: Users can't track installation progress.
decision: Add progress bar to CLI output.
---
```

**Example - After:**
```yaml
---
status: Proposed
problem: Users can't track installation progress.
decision: Add progress bar to CLI output.
rationale: Visual feedback reduces perceived wait time and helps debug stuck installs.
---
```

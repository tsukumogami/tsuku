# II01: Missing Implementation Issues section

A design document with status "Planned" must have an `## Implementation Issues` section.

## Why This Matters

The "Planned" status indicates that implementation has been broken into tracked GitHub issues. The Implementation Issues section documents these issues and their dependencies.

## How to Fix

Add an Implementation Issues section with a milestone and issues table:

```markdown
## Implementation Issues

### Milestone: [Feature Name](https://github.com/org/repo/milestone/N)

| Issue | Title | Dependencies | Tier |
|-------|-------|--------------|------|
| [#123](https://github.com/org/repo/issues/123) | First task | None | testable |
| [#124](https://github.com/org/repo/issues/124) | Second task | [#123](https://github.com/org/repo/issues/123) | testable |
```

## Alternative

If the design isn't ready for implementation planning yet, change the status to "Accepted" instead:

```yaml
---
status: Accepted
...
---
```

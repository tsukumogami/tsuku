# MM03: Edge inside subgraph

An edge (arrow) is defined inside a subgraph block, which may not render correctly.

## The Problem

Edges defined inside subgraphs can cause rendering issues:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Phase1
        A --> B    <-- This edge is inside the subgraph
    end
```

## How to Fix

Move all edges outside of subgraph blocks:

**Before (may not render):**
```
graph TD
    subgraph Phase1
        A["Task A"]
        B["Task B"]
        A --> B
    end
```

**After (correct):**
```
graph TD
    subgraph Phase1
        A["Task A"]
        B["Task B"]
    end

    A --> B
```

## Why This Matters

Mermaid processes subgraphs and edges separately. Edges inside subgraphs may be ignored or cause rendering failures in some viewers.

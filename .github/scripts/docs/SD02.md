# SD02: Superseded missing link

A design document with status "Superseded" must include a link to the document that replaces it.

## Expected Format

The `## Status` section should contain a "Superseded by" line with a link:

```markdown
## Status

Superseded by [DESIGN-new-approach.md](./DESIGN-new-approach.md)
```

## How to Fix

Add the "Superseded by" line with a link to the new design document.

**Example - Before (invalid):**
```markdown
## Status

Superseded
```

**Example - After:**
```markdown
## Status

Superseded by [DESIGN-v2-feature.md](./DESIGN-v2-feature.md)
```

## Note

The link should be a relative path to the new design document. This helps readers understand the evolution of the design and find current documentation.

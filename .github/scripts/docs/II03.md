# II03: Invalid issue link format

An entry in the Issue column has an invalid format.

## Expected Format

Issue links must use markdown link format with the issue number as text:

```markdown
[#123](https://github.com/org/repo/issues/123)
```

Milestone links use the milestone name:

```markdown
[Milestone Name](https://github.com/org/repo/milestone/N)
```

## Common Mistakes

**Plain text (invalid):**
```markdown
| #123 | Title | None | testable |
```

**URL only (invalid):**
```markdown
| https://github.com/org/repo/issues/123 | Title | None | testable |
```

**Wrong link text (invalid):**
```markdown
| [Issue 123](https://github.com/org/repo/issues/123) | Title | None | testable |
```

## How to Fix

Use the correct link format:

```markdown
| [#123](https://github.com/org/repo/issues/123) | Title | None | testable |
```

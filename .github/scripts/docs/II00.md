# II00: Implementation Issues section not allowed in Proposed/Accepted status

An Implementation Issues section was found in a design document with Proposed or Accepted status.

## Why This Matters

The Implementation Issues section is created by the `/plan` command when transitioning a design from Accepted to Planned status. Its presence indicates:

- Issues have been created in GitHub
- A milestone has been assigned
- The design is ready for implementation

Documents in Proposed or Accepted status haven't gone through `/plan` yet, so they shouldn't have this section.

## Status Lifecycle

| Status | Implementation Issues Section |
|--------|------------------------------|
| Proposed | NOT allowed (design under review) |
| Accepted | NOT allowed (approved but not planned) |
| Planned | REQUIRED (issues created via /plan) |
| Current | OPTIONAL (may exist from Planned phase) |
| Superseded | OPTIONAL (historical record) |

## How to Fix

**If the document should be Planned:**
- Change the status to Planned (both frontmatter and Status section)
- Ensure the Implementation Issues section has valid content

**If the document is still Proposed/Accepted:**
- Remove the Implementation Issues section
- The section will be added when you run `/plan` after the design is accepted

## Example

**Invalid - Accepted status with Implementation Issues:**
```yaml
---
status: Accepted
---
```
```markdown
## Implementation Issues

| Issue | Dependencies | Tier |
|-------|--------------|------|
| [#123: Task](url) | None | simple |
```

**Valid - Accepted status without Implementation Issues:**
```yaml
---
status: Accepted
---
```
(no Implementation Issues section)

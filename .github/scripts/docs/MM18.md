# MM18: Open blocker but class is ready

A node has class `ready` but at least one of its upstream dependencies is still open on GitHub. An issue can't be ready for implementation if it's waiting on unfinished work.

## How Blocking is Determined

The validation parses the mermaid diagram's edge relationships (`A --> B` means A blocks B) and checks the actual GitHub state of each blocker. A node with any open upstream dependency should use class `blocked`.

## How to Fix

Change the class from `ready` to `blocked`:

**Before (incorrect -- I100 is still open):**
```
I100 --> I123
class I123 ready
```

**After (correct):**
```
I100 --> I123
class I123 blocked
```

Alternatively, close the blocking issue first if the work is done.

# II08: Strikethrough consistency between issue and associated rows

When an issue row is struck through (completed), its description row and child reference row (if present) must also be struck through.

## Expected Format

**Struck-through issue with description:**
```markdown
| ~~[#123: some feature](url)~~ | ~~None~~ | ~~testable~~ |
| ~~_Implement the feature._~~ | | |
```

**Struck-through issue with child reference and description:**
```markdown
| ~~[#1701: design dashboard observability](url)~~ | ~~None~~ | ~~simple~~ |
| ~~^_Child: [DESIGN-dashboard-observability.md](path)_~~ | | | |
| ~~_Designs the observability layer._~~ | | |
```

## Common Mistakes

**Description row not struck through (invalid):**
```markdown
| ~~[#123: some feature](url)~~ | ~~None~~ | ~~testable~~ |
| _Implement the feature._ | | |
```

**Child reference row not struck through (invalid):**
```markdown
| ~~[#1701: design dashboard](url)~~ | ~~None~~ | ~~simple~~ |
| ^_Child: [DESIGN-dashboard-observability.md](path)_ | | | |
| ~~_Designs the observability layer._~~ | | |
```

## How to Fix

Apply strikethrough (`~~`) to all rows associated with the completed issue:

```markdown
| ~~[#123: some feature](url)~~ | ~~None~~ | ~~testable~~ |
| ~~_Implement the feature._~~ | | |
```

# SC01: Missing required section

One or more required sections are missing from the design document.

## Required Sections

Design documents must have these 9 sections in order:

1. `## Status`
2. `## Context and Problem Statement`
3. `## Decision Drivers`
4. `## Considered Options`
5. `## Decision Outcome`
6. `## Solution Architecture`
7. `## Implementation Approach`
8. `## Security Considerations`
9. `## Consequences`

## How to Fix

Add the missing section(s) with appropriate content.

**Example - Adding a missing section:**
```markdown
## Security Considerations

### Download Verification

```

## Note

Section headers must match exactly, including capitalization. `## security considerations` is not valid.

# CODEOWNERS - Require designated team approvals for security-sensitive changes
#
# This file enforces required reviews for workflow and script changes to prevent
# workflow injection attacks. See docs/designs/DESIGN-batch-pr-coordination.md
# (Phase 0: Security Hardening) for rationale.

# Workflow files - require approval from both core and security teams
# Protects against workflow injection attacks that could push arbitrary code,
# steal secrets, or bypass CI validation.

# Scripts - require approval from core team
# Scripts are called by workflows and could be used to inject malicious behavior.

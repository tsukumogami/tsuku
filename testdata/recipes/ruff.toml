# Test recipe for pipx_install action
#
# This recipe tests the pipx_install implementation in tsuku's action system.
# It installs ruff to verify pipx package installation works correctly,
# including version detection from PyPI registry.
#
# Note: Ruff is a compiled Rust binary distributed via PyPI - no Python needed at runtime.
#
# Related production recipe: recipes/r/ruff.toml

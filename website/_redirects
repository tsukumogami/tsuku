# Cloudflare Pages redirects
# https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/redirects

# Note: Domain-specific routing (get.tsuku.dev vs tsuku.dev) is handled
# by Cloudflare Pages custom domains configuration, not this file.
# This file handles path-based redirects only.

# SPA routing for recipe detail pages
# Serves index.html for all /recipes/* paths, letting client-side router handle the URL
# Must come before any catch-all rule
/recipes/*  /recipes/index.html  200

# Catch-all for SPA - prevents Cloudflare's default fallback to /index.html
# which would show the landing page for unknown routes
/*  /index.html  200

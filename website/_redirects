# Cloudflare Pages redirects
# https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/redirects/

# Note: Domain-specific routing (get.tsuku.dev vs tsuku.dev) is handled
# by Cloudflare Pages custom domains configuration, not this file.
# This file handles path-based redirects only.

# IMPORTANT: A 404.html file exists to disable Cloudflare's implicit SPA behavior.
# Without 404.html, Cloudflare would serve /index.html for all missing paths,
# bypassing these redirect rules entirely.

# SPA routing for recipe detail pages
# Serves recipes/index.html for all /recipes/* paths, letting client-side router handle the URL
# Must come before any catch-all rule
/recipes/*  /recipes/index.html  200

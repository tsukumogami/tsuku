status: Planned
problem: |
  The batch pipeline runs hourly but generates zero new recipes because all remaining
  Homebrew packages fail deterministic generation. The dashboard at tsuku.dev/pipeline/
  displays stale data (last successful batch: Feb 6) and lacks debugging visibility.
  Users can't see why packages fail, circuit breaker status, or ecosystem coverage.
  Meanwhile, disambiguation exists in the CLI but isn't integrated into batch generation,
  and only Homebrew runs despite the design supporting 8 ecosystems.
decision: |
  Augment the pipeline with a unified disambiguated queue. A weekly seeding workflow
  queries all ecosystem APIs, collects quality metrics, applies the 10x disambiguation
  threshold, and produces a single queue where each entry has a pre-resolved source.
  Batch generation uses the source directly (e.g., "github:sharkdp/bat") instead of
  assuming homebrew. The dashboard gains drill-down navigation with full failure
  details, circuit breaker status, and "runs since last success" visibility.
rationale: |
  The root cause is wrong ecosystem routing: packages like bat/fd/rg exist in homebrew's
  queue but should use github/cargo sources. Per-ecosystem rotation with runtime
  disambiguation is a partial fix. By doing disambiguation at seeding time, we get
  quality metrics for all packages, produce a queue where every entry is ready to
  process, and make ecosystem coverage automatic. The 10x popularity threshold from
  DESIGN-disambiguation.md provides a clear decision rule. Dashboard improvements
  can proceed independently to enable debugging while the queue migration is built.

## Upstream Design Reference

This design augments [DESIGN-registry-scale-strategy.md](DESIGN-registry-scale-strategy.md).

**Relevant sections:**
- Failure Analysis System: structured failure tracking
- Phase 2: Failure Analysis Backend + macOS Platform (dashboard infrastructure planned but partially implemented)
- DESIGN-operator-dashboard.md: mentioned as recommended but not created

## Context and Problem Statement

The batch recipe generation pipeline and its dashboard (tsuku.dev/pipeline/) are operational but have gaps that prevent autonomous multi-ecosystem coverage.

**Current state:**
- Pipeline runs hourly via `batch-generate.yml`
- Validation runs across 11 platform environments (5 Linux x86_64 families, 4 Linux arm64 families, 2 macOS architectures)
- Dashboard shows queue status, blockers, failure categories, and recent runs
- Circuit breaker pattern prevents runaway failures

**Root cause hypothesis:**

Popular tools (bat, fd, rg, etc.) should use `github:` or `cargo:` sources, but batch generation hardcodes `--from homebrew:<name>`. These packages don't have Homebrew bottles (they're Rust crates distributed via GitHub releases). All 10 packages selected each hour fail deterministic generation because the pipeline tries to extract bottles that don't exist.

**Observed problems:**

1. **Zero recipe throughput** (symptom): The pipeline has run successfully since Feb 9 but generates 0 new recipes per run. The dashboard shows "last run: Feb 6" because that was the last run that actually merged recipes.

2. **Wrong ecosystem routing** (root cause): Batch generation ignores disambiguation. Packages that should route to `cargo:ripgrep` or `github:sharkdp/bat` fail when processed as `homebrew:ripgrep` or `homebrew:bat`.

3. **No failure debugging** (observability gap): The dashboard shows failure counts but not why packages fail. The `validation_failed` category covers too many distinct problems (missing bottles, bottle extraction errors, verify pattern mismatches).

4. **Single-ecosystem operation** (coverage gap): Despite supporting 8 ecosystems, only Homebrew runs on schedule. Other ecosystems have zero queue entries.

5. **Circuit breaker invisible** (observability gap): The circuit breaker state exists in `batch-control.json` but isn't shown on the dashboard.

### Scope

**In scope:**
- Dashboard enhancements for failure visibility and debugging
- Integration of disambiguation into batch generation
- Multi-ecosystem scheduling
- Failure category refinement

**Out of scope:**
- LLM-based generation (excluded by design in DESIGN-registry-scale-strategy)
- New ecosystems beyond the 8 already supported
- Backend service changes (failure analysis backend is Phase 2, not this design)
- Dashboard styling or UX redesign

## Decision Drivers

1. **Autonomous operation**: The pipeline should run without manual intervention
2. **Debug-first**: Operators need to understand failures before fixing them
3. **Incremental enhancement**: Build on existing infrastructure, don't rebuild
4. **Multi-ecosystem fairness**: All ecosystems should progress, not just Homebrew
5. **Disambiguation early**: Route packages to correct ecosystem before generation
6. **Transparency**: Users should see pipeline health at a glance

## Implementation Context

### Existing Patterns

**Dashboard data flow:**
- `cmd/queue-analytics/` generates `website/pipeline/dashboard.json`
- Workflow `update-dashboard.yml` triggers on `data/` changes
- Frontend JavaScript fetches and renders the JSON

**Batch generation flow:**
- `cmd/batch-generate/` orchestrates via `internal/batch/`
- Selects pending packages from ecosystem-specific queue
- Invokes `tsuku create --from <ecosystem>:<name> --deterministic-only`
- Records failures to `data/failures/<ecosystem>-<timestamp>.jsonl`

**Disambiguation implementation:**
- `internal/discover/` contains ecosystem routing logic
- Manual overrides are queue entries with `confidence: "curated"`
- CLI uses disambiguation in `install` command but not in `create`

### Queue State (as of Feb 15)

```
Total: 5,144 packages
- Pending: 4,988 (97%)
- Success: 138 (2.7%)
- Failed: 14 (0.3%)
- Blocked: 4 (0.1%)
```

All packages are in the homebrew queue. No other ecosystem queues exist.

## Considered Options

### Decision 1: Dashboard Failure Visibility

The dashboard currently shows failure categories but lacks detail for debugging. When all 10 packages fail hourly with `validation_failed`, operators can't determine if it's bottle availability, verify pattern issues, or something else. The failure JSONL files contain this data but aren't exposed.

#### Chosen: Drill-Down Dashboard with Full Detail Pages

Every dashboard panel links to a dedicated page, and every list item links to a detail page. No JSON file inspection required.

**Main dashboard (index.html)** shows summary panels:
- Each panel displays a preview (e.g., last 5 failures, recent 3 runs)
- Each panel header is clickable → navigates to full list page
- "Pipeline Health" panel shows:
  - **Pipeline Status**: "Running" / "Stalled" (based on last_run timestamp)
  - **Last Run**: "1 hour ago (0/10 succeeded)" → click to `run.html?id=<batch-id>`
  - **Last Success**: "9 days ago (2 recipes)" → click to `run.html?id=<batch-id>`
  - **Runs Since Success**: "156 runs" → click to `runs.html?filter=since-last-success`
  - **Circuit Breaker**: per-ecosystem state → click to filtered failures for that ecosystem

**List pages** show complete data:
- `failures.html`: All failures with filtering by category, ecosystem, date range
- `runs.html`: All batch runs with success/fail counts (existing, enhanced)
- `blocked.html`: All blocked packages with dependency info (existing, enhanced)
- `pending.html`: All pending packages by ecosystem (existing)

**Detail pages** show single-item deep dive:
- `failure.html?id=<failure-id>`: Full failure record including:
  - Package ID and ecosystem
  - Category and subcategory
  - Full error message (not truncated)
  - Stack trace or CLI output if available
  - Timestamp and batch ID
  - Platform where failure occurred
  - Link to related workflow run (if available)
- `run.html?id=<batch-id>`: Full batch run details including:
  - All packages processed
  - Per-platform results
  - Recipes generated
  - Failures encountered

**Navigation pattern:**
```
Dashboard Panel → List Page → Detail Page
     ↓                ↓            ↓
  "Failures (42)"  → failures.html → failure.html?id=xyz
  "Recent Runs"    → runs.html     → run.html?id=2026-02-15-homebrew
  "Blocked (4)"    → blocked.html  → (package detail in queue)
```

This reuses existing data in `data/failures/` and `batch-control.json`. The `queue-analytics` command aggregates everything into `dashboard.json` with enough detail for all pages.

#### Alternatives Considered

**Grafana/external dashboarding**: Build metrics pipeline to external service.
Rejected because it adds operational complexity: another service to deploy, another set of credentials to manage, another monitoring target. The dashboard.json is 788KB and serves 5K packages. Grafana's value comes from alerting and historical trends; we need debugging visibility, not time-series analysis.

**Log aggregation**: Point operators to GitHub Actions logs.
Rejected because logs are ephemeral (90 days retention) and require navigating through workflow runs. Finding why `neovim` failed means searching across 20+ workflow runs. A persistent dashboard with recent failures is more accessible.

**Structured JSON in PR comments**: Enhance batch PR bodies with failure details.
Rejected because PR bodies have size limits (65K characters) and aren't queryable for aggregation. The batch workflow already creates PRs with validation summaries; enhancing these would help individual PR review but not overall pipeline debugging.

### Decision 2: Failure Category Refinement

The current `categoryFromExitCode` maps exit codes to categories but lumps too much under `validation_failed`. Exit code 6 covers both "verify pattern mismatch" and "binary not found". Exit code 7 covers "recipe schema invalid" and "install failed". This makes debugging impossible.

#### Chosen: Structured Failure Subcategories

Extend the failure record schema to include a `subcategory` field. The CLI already outputs JSON with `--json`; parse it for additional detail.

New category structure:
```
deterministic_insufficient
  → no_bottle (no bottle available for platform)
  → archive_extraction_failed (bottle exists but extraction fails)
  → binary_discovery_failed (no executables found in archive)

validation_failed
  → verify_pattern_mismatch (version output doesn't match pattern)
  → verify_timeout (verify command didn't complete)
  → install_failed (install action failed)
  → schema_invalid (recipe TOML doesn't validate)

missing_dep
  → (already has blocked_by field)

api_error
  → rate_limited (429 from ecosystem API)
  → upstream_unavailable (5xx from ecosystem API)
  → timeout (network timeout)
```

The `parseInstallJSON` function in `orchestrator.go` already extracts some of this. Extend it to populate subcategory from CLI output.

#### Alternatives Considered

**Exit code explosion**: Add new exit codes for each failure type.
Rejected because exit codes are limited (0-255) and the CLI already uses structured JSON output. Parsing JSON is cleaner than inventing new exit codes.

**Separate log files**: Write different failure types to different files.
Rejected because it fragments the data and makes aggregation harder. A single JSONL with structured fields is easier to query.

### Decision 3: Unified Disambiguated Queue

The current workflow assumes each package comes from the queue's ecosystem. But package names like `rg` exist in multiple ecosystems (homebrew, cargo, github), and the best source varies by tool. Processing `homebrew:bat` when `github:sharkdp/bat` has pre-built binaries wastes CI cycles on certain failure.

#### Chosen: Unified Queue with Durable Disambiguation Decisions

Replace per-ecosystem queues with a single unified queue where each entry includes its pre-resolved source. Disambiguation decisions are durable—computed once and cached until stale or invalidated.

**Key insight**: A tool's best source rarely changes. `ripgrep` should use `cargo:ripgrep` today, next week, and next month. Re-running disambiguation for 5K packages weekly wastes API calls. Instead, treat disambiguation decisions as durable data with freshness tracking.

**Queue entry format** (includes freshness metadata):
```json
{
  "name": "ripgrep",
  "source": "cargo:ripgrep",
  "priority": 1,
  "confidence": "auto",
  "disambiguated_at": "2026-02-15T00:00:00Z",
  "next_retry_at": null
}
```

Note: Quality metrics (download counts, version counts) are stored separately in `data/disambiguations/audit/` for debugging, not in the queue itself. This keeps the queue lean and avoids exposing competitive intelligence in the public dashboard.

**Incremental seeding workflow** (reuses existing ecosystem probers):
1. **New packages**: Disambiguate tools not yet in queue (from ecosystem feeds)
2. **Stale records**: Re-disambiguate if `disambiguated_at` > 30 days
3. **Failed packages**: Re-disambiguate after N consecutive failures (source may have changed)
4. **Manual refresh**: Force re-disambiguation via workflow input or CLI flag

The seeding command imports `internal/discover` directly and calls the disambiguation logic:

```go
import "github.com/tsukumogami/tsuku/internal/discover"

result, err := discover.Disambiguate(toolName, opts)
```

This reuses the ecosystem probers in `internal/discover/` which already handle API rate limits, authentication, and quality metric collection.

**API call estimation**:
- Initial seeding: ~5K calls (one-time)
- Weekly maintenance: ~50 new packages + ~200 stale records + ~10 failure retries = ~260 calls
- Rate limits become a non-issue after initial seeding

**Batch generation** uses the pre-resolved source directly:
```bash
tsuku create --from github:sharkdp/bat --deterministic-only
```

#### Alternatives Considered

**Per-ecosystem queues with rotation**: 8 separate queues, rotate hourly.
Rejected because it doesn't solve the core problem. A package like `bat` in the homebrew queue will always fail homebrew generation because bat doesn't have Homebrew bottles. Rotation just wastes CI cycles on 8 ecosystems instead of 1.

**Full re-disambiguation weekly**: Query all ecosystems for all packages every week.
Rejected because it wastes API calls. Disambiguation results are stable—`ripgrep`'s best source doesn't change week to week. Incremental updates with freshness tracking are more efficient.

**Disambiguation at generation time**: Check curated overrides when processing each package.
Rejected because it's a partial fix. Curated overrides only cover ~30 packages. The 4,988 pending packages would still process from their queue ecosystem. Upfront disambiguation using quality metrics handles the entire queue.

### Decision 4: Seeding Strategy for Multi-Ecosystem Coverage

The current queue contains 5,144 packages but they're all from Homebrew's formula list. Other ecosystems (cargo, npm, pypi, etc.) have popular packages that aren't in Homebrew or have better sources elsewhere.

#### Chosen: Incremental Multi-Source Seeding with Existing Probers

The seeding workflow discovers new packages and maintains disambiguation freshness, reusing the existing ecosystem probers in `internal/discover/`.

**Package discovery** (identifies candidates for disambiguation):
- **homebrew**: `brew formulae --json` (existing seed script)
- **cargo**: crates.io most-downloaded list
- **npm**: npm registry popular packages
- **pypi**: PyPI top packages by downloads
- **rubygems**: RubyGems most-downloaded
- **github**: Curated list of popular CLI tools with releases

**Seeding phases**:

1. **Discovery phase**: Collect tool names from ecosystem feeds
2. **Filter phase**: Skip tools already in queue with fresh disambiguation
3. **Disambiguation phase**: For new/stale tools, call `discover.Disambiguate()` directly
4. **Merge phase**: Update queue with new entries, preserve existing fresh entries

**Re-disambiguation triggers**:
- `disambiguated_at` >= 30 days → stale, re-disambiguate
- `next_retry_at` is set and past → re-disambiguate (exponential backoff after failures)
- **New source discovered** → re-disambiguate (see below)
- Curated overrides → never auto-refresh (manual only)

**New source discovery check**:
When seeding discovers a source for a tool already in the queue, check the audit log:
```
discovered_source IN audit[tool].candidates → already considered, skip
discovered_source NOT IN audit[tool].candidates → new source, re-disambiguate
```

This handles:
- **Bootstrap**: Phase A entries have no audit log, so Phase B discoveries trigger disambiguation
- **New ecosystem added**: Existing tools lack the new ecosystem in their candidates
- **Normal weekly run**: Discoveries match existing candidates, no re-disambiguation needed

**Curated overrides** are queue entries with `confidence: "curated"`:
```json
{"name": "bat", "source": "github:sharkdp/bat", "confidence": "curated", "curated_reason": "pre-built binaries"}
{"name": "rg", "source": "cargo:ripgrep", "confidence": "curated", "curated_reason": "canonical crate"}
```

The unified queue is the single source of truth—no separate curated.jsonl file. To add a curated override, edit the queue entry and set `confidence: "curated"`. The seeding workflow skips re-disambiguation for curated entries.

**Curated sources must be validated** during seeding: if a curated source returns 404 or fails deterministic generation in a test run, alert operators rather than silently using a broken override.

**Failure feedback with exponential backoff**:
Instead of a fixed threshold, use exponential backoff to prevent thrashing:
- 1st failure: Retry on next batch selection (no delay)
- 2nd failure: Set `next_retry_at` to +24 hours
- 3rd failure: Set `next_retry_at` to +72 hours, trigger re-disambiguation
- 4th+ failure: Double the backoff (max 7 days), re-disambiguate each time

This prevents rapid cycling between sources during temporary outages while still catching permanent source changes.

**Source stability alerts**:
When re-disambiguation selects a DIFFERENT source than the previous one for a high-priority package, create a GitHub issue for review rather than automatically accepting the change. This prevents supply chain attacks via ecosystem metric manipulation.

#### Alternatives Considered

**Independent ecosystem queues**: Each ecosystem gets its own queue with its own packages.
Rejected because it creates duplicate work. A package like `ripgrep` would appear in homebrew, cargo, and github queues, processed 3 times with 2 failing.

**Full regeneration weekly**: Re-disambiguate all packages every week.
Rejected because it wastes API calls. With durable disambiguation decisions and freshness tracking, we only re-process new, stale, or failing packages.

**On-demand seeding**: Add packages to queue when users request them.
Rejected for initial implementation because we want autonomous progress. On-demand is a valid addition later via telemetry data, but shouldn't be the only source.

### Assumptions

1. **Existing ecosystem probers work for batch**: The disambiguation probers in `internal/discover/` already implement API fetching, rate limiting, and quality metric collection. The seeding command imports this package directly.

2. **Disambiguation decisions are stable**: A tool's best source rarely changes. This justifies treating disambiguation as durable data with 30-day freshness rather than recomputing weekly.

3. **Curated overrides take precedence**: Queue entries with `confidence: "curated"` are never re-disambiguated by the seeding workflow. This prevents algorithmic churn on packages where an expert has specified the correct source.

4. **Deterministic generation works for selected sources**: The unified queue assumes `tsuku create --from <source> --deterministic-only` succeeds for the sources disambiguation selects. Sources that require LLM generation are excluded from the queue.

5. **Failure categories map to actionable remediation**: Operators know what to do when they see "verify_pattern_mismatch" vs "binary_discovery_failed". If this doesn't hold, we'll need to add resolution guidance to the dashboard.

6. **Dashboard data refresh is sufficient**: The dashboard regenerates when data changes. If all batches fail, no data changes, so the dashboard can become stale. Mitigation: include "generated_at" timestamp prominently.

### Uncertainties

- **Quality metric reliability**: Download counts from ecosystem APIs may be stale or missing. The 10x threshold from DESIGN-disambiguation.md may need tuning for batch contexts.
- **Ecosystem coverage**: Some ecosystems (cpan, go) don't have obvious popularity APIs. May need proxy metrics like GitHub stars or search result ordering.
- **Deterministic source coverage**: What percentage of packages can actually generate deterministically? If most route to `github:` (LLM-required), the unified queue may still be sparse. **Recommendation**: Validate hypothesis by manually testing `tsuku create --from cargo:ripgrep --deterministic-only` before building seeding infrastructure.
- **Freshness threshold tuning**: 30 days is initial value. Track "re-disambiguation source change rate" metric to tune: if >50% of re-disambiguations result in same source, threshold is too short; if source changes frequently, threshold is too long.

### Alerting Strategy

The design requires proactive alerting—dashboards alone aren't sufficient.

**Pipeline health alerts** (create GitHub issues):
- `runs_since_last_success` > 50 (~2 days of hourly batches)
- Circuit breaker open > 24 hours for any ecosystem
- Seeding workflow fails 2 consecutive weeks
- Queue staleness > 20% (entries with `disambiguated_at` > 30 days)

**Source stability alerts** (require manual review):
- High-priority package (priority 1-2) changes source during re-disambiguation
- Curated override validation fails (source returns 404)
- Re-disambiguation selects a source that previously failed for this package

**Implementation**: Add `pipeline-health-monitor.yml` workflow similar to existing `r2-health-monitor.yml` pattern.

### Success Metrics

- **Primary**: Recipe throughput increases from 0/week to >10/week within 2 weeks of deployment
- **Secondary**: Time to diagnose a failure decreases from "check workflow logs" (~5 minutes) to "check dashboard" (~30 seconds)
- **Coverage**: Unified queue includes packages from at least 5 different ecosystems
- **Routing accuracy**: >95% of queue entries have correct source (validated by spot-checking high-priority packages)
- **Health visibility**: Operators can determine pipeline health status in <10 seconds via dashboard

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen: All four enhancements (Dashboard visibility + Category refinement + Unified disambiguated queue + Multi-source seeding)**

### Summary

We're making the pipeline autonomous by addressing its three gaps: visibility, routing, and coverage.

For visibility, the dashboard gains drill-down navigation. Every panel links to a list page, and every list item links to a detail page. "Recent Failures" shows failures with full error messages, CLI output, platform info, and workflow links. "Pipeline Health" distinguishes "last run" (even with 0 recipes) from "last successful run", and shows circuit breaker state per ecosystem. A failing pipeline is visible, not hidden behind stale data.

For routing and coverage, we replace the current homebrew-only queue with a unified disambiguated queue. A weekly seeding workflow queries all ecosystem APIs, collects quality metrics (downloads, version counts, artifact availability), and applies the disambiguation algorithm from DESIGN-disambiguation.md. The result is a single `priority-queue.json` where each entry has a pre-resolved source:

```json
{"name": "bat", "source": "github:sharkdp/bat", "priority": 1, "confidence": "auto"}
{"name": "jq", "source": "homebrew:jq", "priority": 1, "confidence": "curated"}
```

Batch generation uses the source directly: `tsuku create --from github:sharkdp/bat`. No runtime disambiguation lookup needed. Packages that require LLM generation (`github:` sources where deterministic fails) are excluded from the queue or marked for manual review.

Curated overrides (queue entries with `confidence: "curated"`) take precedence over algorithmic decisions. Expert knowledge for packages like `ripgrep` → `cargo:ripgrep` isn't overridden by download count heuristics.

Failure categories get refined subcategories to distinguish "no bottle available" from "verify pattern mismatch" from "binary not found". The existing `parseInstallJSON` function extracts subcategory from CLI JSON output.

### Rationale

The unified queue approach solves the root cause directly. The current problem is that popular tools (bat, fd, rg) are in the homebrew queue but should use github or cargo sources. Per-ecosystem rotation with disambiguation overrides is a partial fix: it helps the ~30 packages with curated records but leaves 4,988 packages routing to potentially wrong ecosystems.

By treating disambiguation as durable data with freshness tracking, we:
1. Pay the API cost once per package (initial disambiguation)
2. Minimize ongoing API calls (~260/week vs ~40K for full regeneration)
3. Get quality metrics for all packages, not just curated ones
4. Create a feedback loop where failures trigger re-disambiguation

The design reuses existing infrastructure:
- Ecosystem probers in `internal/discover/` handle API fetching and rate limits
- Seeding command imports disambiguation logic directly (no CLI wrapper needed)
- Curated overrides work exactly as they do today

The 10x popularity threshold from DESIGN-disambiguation.md provides a clear decision rule, but requires secondary signals for security: a source must have **version_count >= 3** AND **has_repository link** before auto-selection. This prevents typosquatted packages with inflated download counts from being auto-selected. If secondary signals are missing, the seeding workflow prompts for manual review rather than falling back to ecosystem priority (which DESIGN-disambiguation.md explicitly prohibits for auto-selection).

Visibility changes work independently of queue changes. Even if the unified queue takes time to implement, the dashboard improvements immediately help debug the current stalled pipeline.

### Data Flow

How data flows from source files to dashboard pages.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Sources["Data Sources"]
        queue[data/queues/*.json]
        fails[data/failures/*.jsonl]
        metrics[data/metrics/batch-runs.jsonl]
        control[batch-control.json]
        audit[data/disambiguations/audit/]
    end

    subgraph Processing["Processing"]
        analytics[cmd/queue-analytics]
    end

    subgraph Output["Dashboard Data"]
        json[dashboard.json]
    end

    subgraph Pages["Pages"]
        index[index.html]
        lists[List pages]
        details[Detail pages]
    end

    queue --> analytics
    fails --> analytics
    metrics --> analytics
    control --> analytics
    disamb --> analytics

    analytics --> json

    json --> index
    json --> lists
    json --> details

    classDef source fill:#ffccbc
    classDef proc fill:#b3e5fc
    classDef output fill:#c8e6c9
    classDef page fill:#e1bee7

    class queue,fails,metrics,control,disamb source
    class analytics proc
    class json output
    class index,lists,details page
```

### Trigger Flow

When dashboard data gets regenerated.

```mermaid

    subgraph Triggers["Triggers"]
        batch[batch-generate.yml<br/>hourly]
        manual[Manual dispatch]
        push[Push to data/]

    subgraph Workflows["Workflows"]
        gen[Batch Generation]
        update[update-dashboard.yml]
    end

    subgraph Data["Data Updates"]
        queue_update[Queue status changes]
        fail_record[Failure records]
        metric_record[Batch metrics]
    end

    subgraph Dashboard["Dashboard"]
        regen[Regenerate dashboard.json]
        deploy[Deploy to tsuku.dev]
    end

    batch --> gen
    manual --> gen
    gen --> queue_update
    gen --> fail_record
    gen --> metric_record

    queue_update --> push
    fail_record --> push
    metric_record --> push

    push --> update
    update --> regen
    regen --> deploy

    classDef trigger fill:#fff9c4

### Data Structures

**Extended FailureRecord** (internal/batch/failure.go):
```go
type FailureRecord struct {
    PackageID   string   `json:"package_id"`
    Category    string   `json:"category"`
    Subcategory string   `json:"subcategory,omitempty"` // NEW
    BlockedBy   []string `json:"blocked_by,omitempty"`
    Message     string   `json:"message"`
    Timestamp   time.Time `json:"timestamp"`
}
```

**Dashboard health section** (website/pipeline/dashboard.json):
```json
{
  "health": {
    "ecosystems": {
      "homebrew": {
        "breaker_state": "closed",
        "last_failure": "2026-02-08T09:31:11Z",
        "consecutive_failures": 0
      },
      "cargo": {
        "breaker_state": "closed",
        "last_failure": null,
        "consecutive_failures": 0
      }
    },
    "last_run": {
      "batch_id": "2026-02-15-homebrew",
      "ecosystem": "homebrew",
      "timestamp": "2026-02-15T13:45:21Z",
      "succeeded": 0,
      "failed": 10,
      "total": 10
    },
    "last_successful_run": {
      "batch_id": "2026-02-06-homebrew",
      "recipes_merged": 2,
      "timestamp": "2026-02-06T20:45:08Z"
    },
    "runs_since_last_success": 156,
    "hours_since_last_run": 1,
    "hours_since_recipe_merged": 213
  }
}
```

This distinguishes:
- **last_run**: Most recent batch execution (shows pipeline is alive even with 0 recipes)
- **last_successful_run**: Most recent batch that produced recipes
- **runs_since_last_success**: How many batches have run without merging recipes (156 runs = ~6.5 days at hourly)

      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Unified Queue Entry Format

The new queue format includes pre-resolved sources with freshness tracking:

```json
{
  "name": "ripgrep",
  "source": "cargo:ripgrep",
  "priority": 1,
  "status": "pending",
  "confidence": "auto",
  "disambiguated_at": "2026-02-15T00:00:00Z",
  "next_retry_at": null,
  "failure_count": 0
}
```

**Fields:**
- `name`: Tool name (used for display and deduplication)
- `source`: Pre-resolved source in `ecosystem:identifier` format
- `priority`: Priority level (1 = most important)
- `status`: Queue status (see below)
- `confidence`: How source was selected: `curated`, `auto` (10x threshold with secondary signals)
- `disambiguated_at`: When disambiguation was last run (for freshness checking)
- `next_retry_at`: Next eligible retry time (null if no backoff, ISO timestamp if backing off)
- `failure_count`: Count of failures (used for exponential backoff calculation)

**Status values:**
- `pending`: Ready for batch processing
- `success`: Recipe generated and merged
- `failed`: Batch generation failed (will retry with backoff)
- `blocked`: Waiting on dependency
- `requires_manual`: Cannot generate deterministically, needs LLM or human intervention
- `excluded`: Permanently excluded (won't process)

**Packages requiring manual creation** (status: `requires_manual`):
Packages that disambiguate to `github:` sources often can't generate deterministically because GitHub releases lack standardized metadata. These packages:
1. Stay in the queue with `status: "requires_manual"`
2. Are skipped by batch generation (no wasted CI cycles)
3. Appear in the dashboard under a "Requires Manual" filter
4. Can be processed via `tsuku create --from <source>` interactively (with LLM)

**Recipe merge triggers status update** (single flow, two triggers):
When a recipe PR merges to main, a push-triggered workflow updates the queue:
1. Detect which recipe files were added/modified in the push
2. Extract sources from recipe steps (recipes don't have a `[source]` field):
   - `action = "homebrew"` with `formula = "bat"` → `homebrew:bat`
   - `action = "cargo_install"` with `crate = "ripgrep"` → `cargo:ripgrep`
   - `action = "github_archive"` with `repo = "sharkdp/bat"` → `github:sharkdp/bat`
   - A recipe can have multiple sources for different platforms (e.g., homebrew for glibc, github for musl)
3. Find matching queue entries by package name
4. Check if queue entry's `source` is in the recipe's extracted sources:
   - **Queue source IN recipe sources**: Set `status: "success"` (disambiguation was valid, recipe may have added more platform coverage)
   - **Queue source NOT IN recipe sources**: Set `status: "success"`, set `confidence: "curated"` (human chose differently than disambiguation)
   - **Don't update `source` field** - it stays as historical provenance of how we discovered the tool

This handles both single-source and multi-source recipes. If someone adds musl support to a homebrew recipe via github, and the queue had `homebrew:X`, it stays `confidence: "auto"` because homebrew was a valid choice. If someone creates a recipe using cargo when disambiguation selected homebrew, it becomes `confidence: "curated"` to prevent re-disambiguation from overwriting the human choice.

**Note:** `confidence: "priority"` (ecosystem priority fallback) is NOT valid for auto-selection per DESIGN-disambiguation.md. If secondary signals are missing, the entry is flagged for manual review rather than auto-selected.

### Disambiguation Audit Log

Quality metrics are stored separately in `data/disambiguations/audit/<name>.json` for debugging:

```json
{
  "name": "ripgrep",
  "disambiguated_at": "2026-02-15T00:00:00Z",
  "selected_source": "cargo:ripgrep",
  "confidence": "auto",
  "candidates": [
    {
      "source": "cargo:ripgrep",
      "downloads": 1250000,
      "version_count": 47,
      "has_repository": true
    },
    {
      "source": "homebrew:ripgrep",
      "downloads": 89000,
      "version_count": 12,
      "has_repository": true
    }
  ],
  "decision_reason": "10x threshold exceeded (14x), secondary signals present",
  "previous_source": null
}
```

This allows operators to debug disambiguation decisions without exposing competitive intelligence in the public dashboard.

### Batch Generation with Unified Queue

In `orchestrator.go`, the orchestrator uses `pkg.Source` directly:

```go
func (o *Orchestrator) generate(pkg QueueEntry) error {
    // Source is pre-resolved in the queue entry
    source := pkg.Source

    // Skip sources that require LLM (github: typically)
    if !o.supportsDeterministic(source) {
        return o.recordSkipped(pkg, "requires LLM generation")
    }

    // Generate recipe using the pre-resolved source
    cmd := exec.Command("tsuku", "create", "--from", source, "--deterministic-only", "--json")
    // ...
}
```

No runtime disambiguation lookup needed. The seeding workflow already made the decision.

## Implementation Approach

### Planning Summary

This design produces one milestone with three phases:

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Phase 1: Unblock Pipeline** | Queue schema, Bootstrap Phase A, orchestrator changes, recipe merge workflow | Ready for issues |
| **Phase 2: Observability** | Dashboard drill-down, failure subcategories, seeding stats pages | Needs design |
| **Phase 3: Automated Seeding** | Seeding command, weekly workflow, Bootstrap Phase B, ecosystem discovery | Needs design |

**Phase 1 is the critical path** - it unblocks the pipeline immediately.

**Phases 2 and 3** are needs-design issues within this milestone. When designed, each spawns its own milestone with implementation issues.

---

### Phase 1: Unblock Pipeline (Ready for Issues)

This milestone migrates to the unified queue format and gets recipes flowing again.

**Pre-validation step** (before building infrastructure):

Manually test that disambiguation actually helps:
```bash
# Test that the disambiguated sources work for deterministic generation
tsuku create --from cargo:ripgrep --deterministic-only
tsuku create --from github:sharkdp/bat --deterministic-only
```

If these fail, disambiguation doesn't solve the root cause and we need a different approach.

#### Issue 1: Queue Schema Migration

Define the new unified queue format with freshness fields:

```json
{
  "name": "ripgrep",
  "source": "cargo:ripgrep",
  "priority": 1,
  "status": "pending",
  "confidence": "auto",
  "disambiguated_at": "2026-02-15T00:00:00Z",
  "next_retry_at": null,
  "failure_count": 0
}
```

**Deliverables:**
- Queue entry struct in `internal/batch/`
- JSON schema for validation
- Status values: `pending`, `success`, `failed`, `blocked`, `requires_manual`, `excluded`

#### Issue 2: Bootstrap Phase A Script

Run locally to create the initial unified queue:

1. **Scan `recipes/`** → Create `success` entries
   - For each recipe file, extract sources from steps (first/primary source for queue's `source` field)
   - Create queue entry: `status: "success"`, `confidence: "curated"` (recipe existence is authoritative)
   - ~138 entries

2. **Import `curated.jsonl`** → Merge curated overrides
   - For each curated entry not already in queue (from step 1), create entry
   - Set `confidence: "curated"`, `status: "pending"`
   - ~30 entries (minus overlaps with recipes)

3. **Convert existing homebrew queue** → Keep as pending
   - For remaining packages in current `priority-queue-homebrew.json`
   - Set `source: "homebrew:<name>"`, `confidence: "auto"`, `status: "pending"`
   - ~5000 entries

**Deliverables:**
- Bootstrap script (Go or shell)
- `data/queues/priority-queue.json` with unified format
- PR with migrated data

#### Issue 3: Orchestrator Uses Queue Source

Update batch generation to use pre-resolved sources:

1. Update orchestrator to read `pkg.Source` directly instead of hardcoding ecosystem
2. Increment `failure_count` on failure, reset on success
3. Set `next_retry_at` for exponential backoff
4. Filter out `github:` sources that require LLM (deterministic-only batching)
5. Update status to `failed` or `requires_manual` as appropriate

**Deliverables:**
- Modified `internal/batch/orchestrator.go`
- Modified queue reading/writing logic

#### Issue 4: Recipe Merge Workflow

Create workflow that updates queue status when recipes merge:

1. Trigger on push to main affecting `recipes/`
2. Extract sources from recipe steps (can be multiple per recipe)
3. Check if queue source IN recipe sources:
   - **IN**: Set `status: "success"`
   - **NOT IN**: Set `status: "success"`, set `confidence: "curated"`
4. Don't update `source` field (keep as historical provenance)

**Deliverables:**
- New `update-queue-status.yml` workflow
- Source extraction logic for recipe steps

### Phase 2: Observability (Needs Design)

> **Status: Needs design issue before implementation**
>
> This milestone requires exploration to:
> - Validate failure subcategories against actual CLI output and exit codes
> - Define the full dashboard.json schema extension
> - Spec the seeding stats page data requirements

**Scope:**
- Dashboard drill-down navigation (failures.html, failure.html, run.html, seeding.html, curated.html)
- Failure subcategories in batch infrastructure
- Extended dashboard.json schema with failures, health, seeding sections
- Pipeline health panel (circuit breaker state, last success tracking)

**Key questions for design:**
- What are the actual failure subcategories? (Need to audit CLI exit codes and JSON output)
- How much failure history to retain in dashboard.json?
- What seeding stats are most useful for operators?

### Phase 3: Automated Seeding (Needs Design)

> **Status: Needs design issue before implementation**
>
> This milestone requires exploration to:
> - Define PackageDiscovery APIs and criteria for each ecosystem
> - Determine rate limiting strategy per ecosystem
> - Spec the audit log format and retention

**Scope:**
- `cmd/seed-queue/` command with PackageDiscovery, FreshnessChecker, DisambiguationRunner, QueueMerger
- `seed-queue.yml` weekly workflow
- Bootstrap Phase B (full multi-ecosystem disambiguation, run locally)
- New source detection logic (check audit candidates)

**Key questions for design:**
- What APIs for each ecosystem? (crates.io, npm registry, PyPI, RubyGems)
- What criteria for "popular"? (downloads, stars, recent activity)
- How to handle ecosystems with no popularity data?
- Rate limiting strategy (per-ecosystem limits, backoff)

**Bootstrap Phase B** (deferred to this milestone):

Run locally after Phase A is merged:

1. Discover packages from other ecosystems (cargo, npm, pypi, rubygems)
2. Run disambiguation on all packages (new + existing homebrew that might have better sources)
3. Submit as PR with full multi-ecosystem queue and audit logs

**API call estimation**:
- Initial seeding: ~5K disambiguation calls (one-time, run locally during Bootstrap Phase B)
- Weekly maintenance: ~50 new + ~200 stale + ~10 failures = ~260 calls
- Rate limits are non-issue in CI after bootstrap is complete

## Security Considerations

### Download Verification

**No change.** Recipe generation and installation continue to use existing checksum verification. Downloaded artifacts are validated against checksums from ecosystem APIs (Homebrew bottle checksums, npm integrity hashes, etc.).

### Execution Isolation

**No change.** Batch generation runs in GitHub Actions CI with ephemeral runners. Generated recipes are validated in Docker containers (Linux) or sandboxed macOS environments. No new execution surface is added.

### Supply Chain Risks

**Disambiguation lookup is read-only.** The curated disambiguations file is checked into the repository and reviewed via PR. Batch generation reads this file but can't modify it during execution.

**New ecosystem queues follow existing patterns.** Cargo, npm, and other ecosystems use the same seeding approach as Homebrew: query public APIs for popular packages, store in static JSON files, generate recipes deterministically from official ecosystem sources.

**No new external dependencies.** All ecosystem APIs are already used by tsuku's builders. Multi-ecosystem rotation doesn't introduce new API integrations.

### User Data Exposure

**Minimal operational data only.** The dashboard displays pipeline operational data: failure counts, batch metrics, package names processed, and platform information. No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected or displayed. Error messages in failure records could contain path information from CI environments, but these are ephemeral runner paths with no user association.

Note: The failure records reveal ecosystem trends (which packages are being processed) and platform distribution (OS, architecture). This is acceptable for a public package manager where all recipes are public anyway.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Debugging enabled**: Operators can now see why packages fail without reading workflow logs
- **Multi-ecosystem coverage**: Unified queue naturally includes packages from all ecosystems
- **Correct routing**: Disambiguation at seeding time means every queue entry has the right source
- **Health visibility**: Circuit breaker state and "runs since success" visible at a glance
- **No wasted cycles**: Packages like `bat` use `github:sharkdp/bat` directly, not failing homebrew
- **Incremental**: Builds on existing infrastructure without rebuilding

### Negative

- **Seeding workflow dependency**: Queue quality depends on seeding workflow. If seeding fails repeatedly, queue becomes stale. Mitigation: freshness is gradual (30-day threshold), so occasional failures don't immediately impact batch processing.
- **Quality metric gaps**: Some ecosystems (go, cpan) lack clear popularity APIs; will use proxies or heuristics.
- **LLM exclusion**: Packages that require LLM generation (many `github:` sources) are excluded from batch processing.
- **Initial seeding cost**: First run disambiguates ~5K packages, which takes time. Subsequent runs are incremental (~260 packages/week).

### Neutral

- **CI cost unchanged**: Same hourly budget
- **No new external services**: Still static JSON, no Grafana/Prometheus/etc.
- **Queue migration**: Existing homebrew queue is archived, unified queue replaces it

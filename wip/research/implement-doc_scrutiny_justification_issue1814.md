# Scrutiny Review: Justification Focus -- Issue #1814

**Issue:** #1814 ci(test-recipes): batch Linux per-recipe jobs in test-changed-recipes
**Scrutiny Focus:** justification
**Date:** 2026-02-21

## Summary

All 28 acceptance criteria are reported as "implemented" with no deviations. The justification focus evaluates the quality of deviation explanations. With zero deviations, there are no explanations to evaluate.

## Proportionality Check

Even though there are no deviations to scrutinize, the justification focus includes a proportionality sub-check: are deviations proportionate to the implementation?

With zero deviations on 28 ACs, proportionality is trivially satisfied. The implementation touches two files (`.github/ci-batch-config.json` and `.github/workflows/test-changed-recipes.yml`), which is consistent with the issue scope (batch Linux per-recipe jobs in a single workflow).

## Avoidance Pattern Check

No deviations means no avoidance patterns to flag.

## Findings

None.

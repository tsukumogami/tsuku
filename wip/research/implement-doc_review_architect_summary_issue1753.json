  "summary": "The implementation correctly fixes the dead gRPC connection caching bug identified in the design doc. The fix isolates the error recovery to the provider layer (invalidating p.conn and p.client on gRPC error), respects the separation between addon management, server lifecycle, and client connection management, and includes comprehensive tests for both the error recovery path and happy path. No blocking architectural violations or new dependencies introduced. Test coverage validates the core behavior directly via sendRequest() testing plus integration-style testing through mock servers.",

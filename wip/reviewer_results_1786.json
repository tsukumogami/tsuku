  "disposition_rationale": "Pragmatic B1 (hardcoded pipeline matrix): deliberate choice over YAML parsing to keep tests deterministic. Hardcoded list serves as the assertion; if pipeline changes, test catches it. Pragmatic B2 (metadata snapshot): documents current platform support and correctly fails if changed without test update. Both are snapshot/change-detector tests by design."

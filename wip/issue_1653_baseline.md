# Issue 1653 Baseline

## Environment
- Date: 2026-02-14T20:05:00Z
- Branch: feature/1652-ambiguous-match-error (reused from #1652)
- Base commit: 9bdd10a2 (includes #1652 implementation)

## Test Results
Inherited from #1652 baseline - all tests pass except pre-existing network test failure.

## Build Status
PASS - verified during #1652 implementation

## Notes
This issue builds on #1652's AmbiguousMatchError implementation. The error type and formatting are already complete; this issue adds CLI handling.

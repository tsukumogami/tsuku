      "summary": "Milestone 15 successfully delivered all three strategic milestones from the design document. The implementation achieved the core vision of deterministic recipe execution through a two-phase architecture (eval/exec), with plans stored in state.json and full checksum verification. Two enhancements beyond the design scope were implemented: action decomposition to primitives and nested dependency plans for self-contained installations.",

      "summary": "Milestone M15 documentation is partially complete with significant gaps. Basic plan-based installation is well-documented, but 14 new ecosystem primitives are completely undocumented for users. Critical missing content includes: ecosystem primitive explanation, determinism guarantees, lockfile capture mechanism, and updated ecosystem support claims in README.md. Design docs are excellent but user-facing documentation needs Priority 1 additions before milestone can be considered fully complete.",

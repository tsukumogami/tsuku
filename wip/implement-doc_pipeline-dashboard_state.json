Source extraction covers 10 ecosystem action types plus fallback to version.github_repo. Only 7 of ~274 recipes are skipped (manual installs, source builds). Recipe entries get default priority 3; homebrew queue preserves tier values as priority. Curated overrides get priority 1. Output sorted by priority then name for stable ordering. Output uses UnifiedQueue wrapper with schema_version, updated_at, and entries fields."

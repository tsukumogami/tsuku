  "disposition_rationale": "All blocking findings assessed as non-regressions: (1) NewLocalProviderWithInstaller is the designed API surface per issue spec for production wiring, not dead code. (2) isGPUVariantInstalled returning true is a documented conservative choice avoiding state.json dependency; costs one idempotent reinstall per cold start. (3) addonPath direct mutation writes same cached value from mutex-protected EnsureAddon; not a corruption risk. (4) isRunningLocked comment is pre-existing per git diff, not introduced by this commit."

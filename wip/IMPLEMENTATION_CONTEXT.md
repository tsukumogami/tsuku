## Goal

Consolidate the golden file testing design documents by incorporating key content from the superseded design into the parent document.

## Context

The design document reorganization (issue #843) identified that `DESIGN-golden-plan-testing.md` is the canonical parent design that supersedes the family support design.

Parent: `docs/designs/current/DESIGN-golden-plan-testing.md`

Superseded designs (now in archive/):
- `DESIGN-golden-family-support.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Review superseded design for unique content not present in parent
- [ ] Incorporate relevant implementation details into parent design
- [ ] Ensure parent design captures the complete golden file testing approach including family support
- [ ] Update any cross-references in other documents that point to superseded design
- [ ] Parent design remains coherent and well-organized after consolidation

## Dependencies

Blocked by #843 (design document reorganization)

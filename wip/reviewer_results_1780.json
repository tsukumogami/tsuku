  "disposition_rationale": "The benchmark script has real issues (calls non-existent tsuku llm bench/complete commands), but the actual validation gate checks the results template markdown file, not the script. The results template passes all structural validation checks. The benchmark script is automation for manual GPU testing that requires hardware not available in CI. The script will need fixes when GPU hardware is available for actual benchmark execution. The issue spec explicitly requires GPU hardware for measurements."

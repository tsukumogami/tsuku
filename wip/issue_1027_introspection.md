# Issue 1027 Introspection

## Context Reviewed
- Design doc: docs/designs/DESIGN-release-workflow-native.md
- Sibling issues reviewed: #1025 (CLOSED), #1026, #1028, #1030, #1031, #1040
- Prior patterns identified: None for Rust projects (this is the first)

## Gap Analysis

### Minor Gaps
- Design doc was updated with release notes workflow (annotated tag approach)
- This doesn't affect #1027 - the Rust project structure is unchanged

### Moderate Gaps
None

### Major Gaps
None

## Recommendation
**Proceed**

## Notes
#1025 was just closed (the blocking issue). Design doc updates were for release notes workflow (annotated tags) and goreleaser integration settings - neither affects the Rust project structure defined in Step 3.

The issue spec is complete with exact file contents specified in the Technical Approach section.
